The practice schedule is subject to change, so social media is the best way to keep up with what's going on. Each year, the club has the goal of reaching the National Collegiate Disc Golf Championships (www.ncdgc.com). The easiest way to know what the club is up to is on our Instagram.

Our society was founded in 2015 by five graduate students at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Under the guidance of Dr. Jennifer Munroe and our sponsor organization, the Early Modern Recipes Online Collective (EMROC), our founders and first officers &ndash; Kailan, Breanne, Taryn, Robin, and Nadia &ndash; joined forces to start EMPS and recruit its first members. During our meetings, EMPS members learn to read secretary hand and transcribe using the Folger Shakespeare Library&lsquo;s Dromio software and learn a lot about the early modern period. We travel to and participate in out-of-state transcribathons and host our own annual transcribathon (our first, in April 2016, had over 70 attendees!). We also cook early modern recipes, write blogs, research, and discuss the early modern period when we&rsquo;re together. As our constitution states, EMPS exists to: -facilitate the teaching and practice of paleography and transcription; -disseminate interdisciplinary perspectives of early modern manuscripts; -facilitate networking amongst students, faculty, and community members with interest in paleography and transcription; -provide a platform for students, faculty, and community members to contribute to new and ongoing academic databases.

        "Description": "<p>The PROUD brothers of Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity Inc. are the first and largest Latin fraternity in the nation. The organization was founded on December 1st, 1975 in Kean University. The founders of Lambda Theta Phi had a vision of unifying the Latinos of Kean University to create a movement that would seek to educate, respect, cultivate, protect, and inspire the community with acts of chivalry. Their vision lives today in the passion of every Lambda entity across the nation. The Lambdas at UNC Charlotte are recognized as the Gamma Iota Chapter of Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity Inc. and were founded on this campus on May 6th, 2007. Since then, the Lambdas have welcomed men of all backgrounds in to the family who wish to challenge social injustices, to empower young minds, to cultivate unity in the community, develop their character, in service of humanity. The Lambdas seek to ignite a change in a man with a vision that the legacy of their community rests in their hands. \"En La Uni&oacute;n, Est&aacute; La Fuerza\" or, \"In Unity, there is Strength\" is the strong hold and motto that drives the Lambda man to persist in his journey as the self-conquered man. As the first nationally recognized Latin fraternity in the nation, the brothers of Lambda Theta Phi set the precedent for the identity for other Latino Greek organizations. With that, they initiated a tradition that transcends generations of pride and heritage. The brothers of Lambda Theta Phi perform poetry in motion known as \"Saluting\" to pay respect to their ancestors, and release passion and energy that drives their motivation. We challenge every man to see their world with a different eye in the hopes to cultivate the mentality of agents of change.</p>",

Philosophy is about improving ourselves and changing the world we live in by being that change. It is to know ourselves so that we can be ourselves. Our exploration of Wisdom of the East and West will include some of the most interesting thinkers and civilizations of all time!\r\n\r\nOur Culture\r\n\r\nWe want to promote culture as a way to express the human values of generosity, creativity, understanding, fraternity and eclecticism. Our cultural activities include seminars, courses, museum visits, visits to sacred sites, historical exhibitions, artistic exhibitions, theater, concerts, yoga and tai chi. We promote a spirit of openness to the rich diversity of culture as well as reconnecting with nature.\r\n\r\nOur Volunteering\r\n\r\nTo volunteer is to express one's true self. It is to give with an open heart. Unfortunately, our society sometimes promotes an attitude of “give and take” which causes us to forget the true nature of generosity. Volunteering is a great way to develop a pure, unconditional contact with the unselfish aspect of our nature.

Sex Week is bringing together organizations on and off-campus to create a unified educational experience that addresses topics of sex safety, sex positivity, sexuality and gender orientation, and much more. We want to encourage an environment in which students feel comfortable asking questions and talking about sex.</p>\r\n<p>Our series of programs Red Zone (September) and Sex Week (February) happen every year, so if you want to help plan for next year, volunteer for events as they come up, or leave us any feedback, let us know at sexweekuncc@gmail.com!

        "Description": "<p>What is Sigma Alpha Epsilon? Over one-hundred fifty years ago, at the University of Alabama, eight men of the graduating class of 1856 were the first brothers in Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Studying in the classics, they formed a fraternity governed by age old Greek principles and the highest standards for entrance. Our brothers fought on both sides of the civil war, and many chapters were lost. In fact, only one chapter stayed active throughout the entire civil war, Washington City Rho at Washington Military Academy. Many other chapters were revived after the war, including the famous Kentucky Chi, where before the war; a woman was entrusted with the sacred documents that govern Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Lucie Pattie was given the handshake by a brother of that chapter (who died in the war) and was not to release the documents to any other person until that sacred greeting was given. When a different brother returned and shook Miss Pattie's hand, the documents were received and the chapter was revived! Over the summer of 1925, the national convention spawned the idea of the first and only fraternal leadership school. Through the great depression, amazingly, not a single chapter went under. In this century of prosperity for Sigma Alpha Epsilon, we have to grown to over 220 chapters. These chapters have initiated over 300,000 brothers. That's the highest membership total of any fraternity! Through thick and thin, hardship and good times, the international fraternity of Sigma Alpha Epsilon has stood as a leader in the Greek community as well as many college communities in the United States and Canada. We believe that Sigma Alpha Epsilon has all the qualities that make a great national fraternity, but we know that SAE might not be for everyone. If you do choose to rush and join our fraternity, we know that you'll be pleasantly surprised with all the support that can come from the chapter and the national fraternity</p>",

Most of our players started out with not knowing anything about rugby. With the help of our excellent coaching staff, we are prepared to teach anyone the fundamentals of rugby. We teach you how to ruck, how to pass a rugby ball, how to kick, catch and everyone's favorite, how to tackle. There are many more techniques to the sport, but we start with the basics and go from there. Practice is Tuesdays and Thursdays 6:00pm-8:00pm at Field 12. Come on out!</p>",
