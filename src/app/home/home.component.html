      <h1>What Is Events+?</h1>
      <h2>A Magical Place, That's What!</h2>
      <p>
        EVENTS+ allows UNCC Students to discover events happening
        all around campus and indicate that they will be attending.
        In addition, students can create and edit their profiles and
        post their own events for others to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope for the users of EVENT+ to have a happy and easy time
        using our website to organize events.
